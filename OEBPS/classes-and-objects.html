<h1>Classes and Objects</h1>


<p>You've now seen the basics of classes and objects in Scala from the previous two chapters. In this chapter,
we'll take you a bit deeper. You'll learn more about classes, fields, and methods, and get an overview of semicolon inference.
We'll discuss singleton objects, including how to use them to write and run a Scala application.
If you are familiar with Java, you'll find
that the concepts in Scala are similar, but not exactly the same. 
So even if you're a Java guru, it will pay to read on.</p>

<h3 id="sec-classes-fields-methods">4.1 Classes, fields, and methods</h3>


<p>A class is a blueprint for objects<a id="i853620774-1"/>. Once you define a class, you can create objects from the
class blueprint with the keyword <span class="code">new</span>.<a id="i313049961-1"/><a id="i-1663070161-1"/> For example, given the class
definition:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">class</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="comment">//&nbsp;class&nbsp;definition&nbsp;goes&nbsp;here</code>
  }
</pre>


<p>You can create <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> objects with:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">new</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>
</pre>


<p>Inside a class definition, you place fields and methods, which are
collectively called
<em>members</em>.<a id="i1842841433-1"/><a id="i1490663010-1"/><a id="i-1274708295-1"/><a id="i1074702876-1"/><a id="i955534258-1"/> Fields, which you define
with either <span class="code">val</span> or <span class="code">var</span>, are variables
that refer to objects<a id="i521418335-1"/><a id="i1295914649-1"/>. Methods, which you define with <span class="code">def</span>, contain
executable code.<a id="i1764649166-2"/> The fields hold the state, or data, of an object, whereas the methods use that data to do
the computational work of the object. When you instantiate a class, the runtime
sets aside some memory to hold the
image of that object's state (<i>i.e.</i>, the content of its variables). For example, if you defined a <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>
class and gave it a <span class="code">var</span> field named <span class="code">sum</span>:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">class</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">var</code>&nbsp;sum&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">0</code>
  }
</pre>


<p>and you instantiated it twice with:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">val</code>&nbsp;acc&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="vem">new</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>
  <code class="vem">val</code>&nbsp;csa&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="vem">new</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>
</pre>


<p>The image of the objects in memory might look like this:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/cc0dd0160.png" alt="image images/cc0dd0160.png"/>


</div>


<p>Since <span class="code">sum</span>, a field declared inside class <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>, is a <span class="code">var</span>, not a <span class="code">val</span>, you can later reassign to <span class="code">sum</span> a
different <span class="code">Int</span> value, like this:</p>

<pre>
  acc.sum&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">3</code>
</pre>


<p>Now the picture would look like this:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/cc3dd0160.png" alt="image images/cc3dd0160.png"/>


</div>


<p>One thing to notice about this picture is that there are two <span class="code">sum</span> variables, one in the object referenced
by <span class="code">acc</span> and the other in the object referenced by <span class="code">csa</span>. Fields are
also known as <em>instance variables</em>,<a id="i-1571995732-1"/><a id="i-813534408-1"/> because
every instance gets its own set of the variables. Collectively, an object's instance variables make up the memory image of the object. You see this illustrated here not only in that you see two <span class="code">sum</span> variables, but also that when you changed one, the other was unaffected.</p>

<p>Another thing to note in this example is that you were able to mutate the object <span class="code">acc</span> referred to, even
though <span class="code">acc</span> is a <span class="code">val</span>. What you can't do with <span class="code">acc</span> (or <span class="code">csa</span>), given that they
are <span class="code">val</span>s, not <span class="code">var</span>s, is reassign a different object to them. For example, the following attempt would fail:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="comment">//&nbsp;Won't&nbsp;compile,&nbsp;because&nbsp;acc&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;val</code>
  acc&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="vem">new</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>
</pre>


<p>What you can count on, therefore, is that <span class="code">acc</span> will always refer to the same <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> object with which you initialize it, but the fields
contained inside that object might change over time.</p>

<p>One important way to pursue robustness of an object is to ensure that
the object's state&mdash;the values of its instance variables&mdash;remains
valid during its entire lifetime. The first step is to prevent
outsiders from accessing the fields directly by making the fields
<em>private</em>.<a id="i694224322-1"/><a id="i1692219636-1"/> Because private fields can only be accessed by methods
defined in the same class, all the code that can update the state will
be localized to the class. To declare a field private, you place a <span class="code">private</span>
access modifier in front of the field, like this:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">class</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">private</code>&nbsp;<code class="vem">var</code>&nbsp;sum&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">0</code>
  }
</pre>


<p>Given this definition of <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>, any attempt to access <span class="code">sum</span> from the outside of the class would fail:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">val</code>&nbsp;acc&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="vem">new</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>
  acc.sum&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">5</code>&nbsp;<code class="comment">//&nbsp;Won't&nbsp;compile,&nbsp;because&nbsp;sum&nbsp;is&nbsp;private</code>
</pre>


<div class="note">
<h4>Note</h4>


<p>The way you make members public in Scala is by not explicitly specifying
any access modifier<a id="i807441147-1"/>. Put another way, where you'd
say "public" in Java, you simply say nothing in Scala. Public is Scala's default access level.</p>

</div>


<p>Now that <span class="code">sum</span> is private, the only code that can access <span class="code">sum</span> is code defined inside the body of the class itself.
Thus, <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> won't be of much use to anyone unless we define some methods in it:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">class</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>&nbsp;{
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">private</code>&nbsp;<code class="vem">var</code>&nbsp;sum&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">0</code>
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">def</code>&nbsp;add(b:&nbsp;<code class="typename">Byte</code>):&nbsp;<code class="typename">Unit</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum&nbsp;+=&nbsp;b
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">def</code>&nbsp;checksum():&nbsp;<code class="typename">Int</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">return</code>&nbsp;<code style="font-size:large">~</code>(sum&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<code class="literal">0xFF</code>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code class="literal">1</code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
  }
</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> now has two methods, <span class="code">add</span> and <span class="code">checksum</span>, both of which exhibit the basic form of a
function definition, shown in <a href="first-steps-in-scala.html#fig-method-form">Figure 2.1</a>  <a href="first-steps-in-scala.html#fig-method-form">here</a>.</p>

<p>Any parameters to a method can be used inside the method. One
important characteristic of method parameters in Scala is that they
are <span class="code">val</span>s, not <span class="code">var</span>s.<a href="classes-and-objects.html#footnotemain4-1">[1]</a><a id="i1448353285-1"/>
If you attempt to reassign a parameter inside a method in Scala, therefore, it won't compile:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">def</code>&nbsp;add(b:&nbsp;<code class="typename">Byte</code>):&nbsp;<code class="typename">Unit</code>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;b&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">1</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="comment">//&nbsp;This&nbsp;won't&nbsp;compile,&nbsp;because&nbsp;b&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;val</code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;sum&nbsp;+=&nbsp;b
  }
</pre>


<p>Although <span class="code">add</span> and <span class="code">checksum</span> in this version of
<span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> correctly implement the desired functionality, you
can express them using a more concise style.
First, the <span class="code">return</span> at the end of the <span class="code">checksum</span> method is
superfluous and can be dropped. In the absence of any explicit return
statement, a Scala method returns the last value computed by the
method.<a id="i-2127509767-1"/><a id="i119623890-1"/></p>

<p>The recommended style for methods is in fact to avoid having explicit,
and especially multiple, return statements. Instead, think of each method as an expression that
yields one value, which is returned. This philosophy will encourage you to make methods quite small, 
to factor larger methods into multiple smaller ones. On the other hand, design choices depend on the design context, and
Scala makes it easy to write methods that have multiple, explicit <span class="code">return</span>s if that's what you desire.</p>

<p>Because all <span class="code">checksum</span> does is calculate a value, it does not need an
explicit <span class="code">return</span>. 
Another shorthand for methods is that you can leave off the
curly braces if a method computes only a single result expression.  If
the result expression is short, it can even be placed on the same line
as the <span class="code">def</span> itself. For the utmost in conciseness, you can leave off the
result type and Scala will infer it. With these changes, class <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> looks
like this:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">class</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">ChecksumAccumulator</code>&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">private</code>&nbsp;<code class="vem">var</code>&nbsp;sum&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="literal">0</code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">def</code>&nbsp;add(b:&nbsp;<code class="typename">Byte</code>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum&nbsp;+=&nbsp;b
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">def</code>&nbsp;checksum()&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code style="font-size:large">~</code>(sum&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<code class="literal">0xFF</code>)&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code class="literal">1</code>
  }
</pre>


<p>Although the Scala compiler will correctly infer the result types of the
<span class="code">add</span> and <span class="code">checksum</span> methods shown in the previous example, readers of the code
will also need to <span class="textit">mentally infer</span> the result types by studying the bodies of
the methods.
As a result it is often better to explicitly
provide the result types of public methods declared in a class
even when the compiler would infer it for you.
<a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-checksum-class">Listing 4.1</a>
shows this style.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;}

<h5>Listing 4.1 - Final version of class <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>.</h5>


<p>Methods with a result type of <span class="code">Unit</span>, such as <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>'s <span class="code">add</span> method,
are executed for their side effects.
A side effect is generally defined as mutating state somewhere
external to the method or performing an I/O action. In <span class="code">add</span>'s case, the side effect is that 
<span class="code">sum</span> is reassigned.
A method that is 
executed only for its side effects is known as a <em>procedure</em>.<a id="i-163214618-1"/><a id="i408410112-1"/><a id="i-1220669121-1"/></p>

<h3 id="sec-semicolon-inf">4.2 Semicolon inference</h3>


<p>In a Scala program, a
semicolon<a id="i1984943760-1"/><a id="i794983274-1"/> at the end of a statement is usually
optional<a id="i-491339878-1"/>.  You can type one if you want but you don't have to if the
statement appears by itself on a single line. On the other hand,
a semicolon is required if you write multiple statements on a
single line:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">val</code>&nbsp;s&nbsp;=&nbsp;<code class="quotedstring">"hello"</code>;&nbsp;println(s)
</pre>


<p>If you want to enter a statement that spans multiple lines, most of
the time you can simply enter it and Scala will separate the
statements in the correct place.  For example, the following is
treated as one four-line statement:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">if</code>&nbsp;(x&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<code class="literal">2</code>)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;println(<code class="quotedstring">"too&nbsp;small"</code>)
  <code class="vem">else</code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;println(<code class="quotedstring">"ok"</code>)
</pre>


<p>Occasionally, however, Scala will split a statement into two
parts against your wishes:</p>

<pre>
  x
  +&nbsp;y
</pre>


<p>This parses as two statements <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">+y</span>.  If you intend it to parse
as one statement <span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y</span>, you can always wrap it in parentheses:</p>

<pre>
  (x
  +&nbsp;y)
</pre>


<p>Alternatively, you can put the <span class="code">+</span> at the end of a
line.<a id="i-1344376109-1"/><a id="i1115343227-1"/>
For just this reason, whenever you are chaining an infix operation such
as <span class="code">+</span>, it is a common Scala style to put the operators at the end
of the line instead of the beginning:</p>

<pre>
  x&nbsp;+
  y&nbsp;+
  z
</pre>


<div class="aside">
<h3>The rules of semicolon inference</h3>


<p>The precise rules for statement separation<a id="i1984943760-2"/> are surprisingly simple for
how well they work.  In short, a line ending is treated as a semicolon
unless one of the following conditions is true:</p>

<ol>


<li>The line in question ends in a word that would not be legal as the end of a statement,
such as a period or an infix operator.


</li>
<li>The next line begins with a word that cannot start a statement.


</li>
<li>The line ends while inside parentheses <span class="code">(...)</span> or brackets <span class="code">[...]</span>, 
because these cannot contain multiple statements anyway.


</li></ol>


</div>


<h3 id="sec-singleton-objects">4.3 Singleton objects</h3>


<p>As mentioned in <a href="a-scalable-language.html">Chapter 1</a>, one way in
which Scala is more object-oriented than Java is that classes in Scala
cannot have static members.<a id="i-100664180-1"/><a id="i-1455692441-1"/> Instead, Scala has <a href="glossary.html#g775061748"><em>singleton objects</em></a>.<a id="i-1742889473-1"/><a id="i-1642091000-1"/> A singleton object definition looks like a class definition,
except instead of the keyword <span class="code">class</span> you use the keyword
<span class="code">object</span>. <a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-checksum-obj">Listing 4.2</a> shows an example.</p>

<p>The singleton object in this figure is named <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>,
the same name as the class in the previous example.  When a singleton
object shares the same name with a class, it is called that class's
<a href="glossary.html#g423027411"><em>companion object</em></a>.<a id="i541826262-1"/> You must define both
the class and its companion object in the same source file. The class
is called the <a href="glossary.html#g-828430492"><em>companion class</em></a> of the singleton object. A class
and its companion object can access each other's private members.<a id="i-1552749806-1"/><a id="i-216316744-1"/></p>

<h5>Listing 4.2 - Companion object for class <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>.</h5>


<p>The <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> singleton object has one method,
named <span class="code">calculate</span>, which takes a <span class="code">String</span> and calculates a checksum for
the characters in the <span class="code">String</span>.  It also has one private field,
<span class="code">cache</span>, a mutable map in which previously calculated checksums are
cached.<a href="classes-and-objects.html#footnotemain4-2">[2]</a>  The first line of the method,
"<span class="code">if</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">(cache.contains(s))</span>", checks the cache to see if the passed
string is already contained as a key in the map. If so, it just
returns the mapped value, <span class="code">cache(s)</span>. Otherwise, it executes the
else clause, which calculates the checksum.  The first line of the
else clause defines a <span class="code">val</span> named <span class="code">acc</span> and initializes it with a
new <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> instance.<a href="classes-and-objects.html#footnotemain4-3">[3]</a> The next line is a
<span class="code">for</span> expression, which cycles through each character in the passed string,
converts the character to a <span class="code">Byte</span> by invoking <span class="code">toByte</span> on it, and
passes that to the <span class="code">add</span> method of the <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>
instances to which <span class="code">acc</span> refers. After the <span class="code">for</span> expression completes,
the next line of the method invokes <span class="code">checksum</span> on <span class="code">acc</span>, which gets
the checksum for the passed <span class="code">String</span>, and stores it into a <span class="code">val</span>
named <span class="code">cs</span>. In the next line, <span class="code">cache</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+=</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">(s</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">-&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">cs)</span>, the passed
string key is mapped to the integer checksum value, and this key-value
pair is added to the cache map. The last expression of the method,
<span class="code">cs</span>, ensures the checksum is the result of the method.</p>

<p>If you are a Java programmer, one way to think of singleton objects is
as the home for any static methods you might have written in Java.
You can invoke methods on singleton objects using a similar syntax:
the name of the singleton object, a dot, and the name of the
method. For example, you can invoke the <span class="code">calculate</span> method of
singleton object <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> like this:</p>

<pre>
  ChecksumAccumulator.calculate(<code class="quotedstring">"Every&nbsp;value&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;object."</code>)
</pre>


<p>A singleton object is more than a holder of static methods, however. It is
a first-class object.
You can think of a singleton object's name, therefore, as a "name tag" attached to the object:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/csaObject160.png" alt="image images/csaObject160.png"/>


</div>


<p>Defining a singleton object doesn't define a type (at the Scala level
of abstraction). Given just a definition of object
<span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>, you can't make a variable of type
<span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>. Rather, the type named <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> 
is defined by the singleton object's companion class. However, singleton objects extend a superclass and can mix in traits. Given
each singleton object is an instance of its superclasses and mixed-in
traits, you can invoke its methods via these types, refer to it from
variables of these types, and pass it to methods expecting these
types.  We'll show some examples of singleton objects
inheriting from classes and traits in <a href="packages-and-imports.html">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

<p>One difference between classes and singleton objects is that singleton<a id="i-614433232-1"/>
objects cannot take parameters, whereas classes can. Because you can't instantiate a singleton object with the <span class="code">new</span> keyword,
you have no way to pass parameters to it.
Each singleton object is implemented as<a id="i-1705632190-1"/><a id="i1357897992-1"/>
an instance of a <a href="glossary.html#g1908038877"><em>synthetic class</em></a> referenced from a static variable, so they have the same initialization semantics as Java
statics.<a href="classes-and-objects.html#footnotemain4-4">[4]</a> In particular, a singleton object is initialized the first
time some code accesses it.</p>

<p>A singleton object that does not share the same name with a companion
class is called a <a href="glossary.html#g1856979834"><em>standalone object</em></a>.<a id="i1181640299-1"/><a id="i1731800121-1"/> You can use standalone
objects for many purposes, including collecting related utility
methods together or defining an entry point to a Scala
application. This use case is shown in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="sec-a-scala-application">4.4 A Scala application</h3>


<p>To run a Scala program, you must supply the name of a standalone singleton object with a <span class="code">main</span> method that takes one parameter, an <span class="code">Array[String]</span>,
and has a result type of <span class="code">Unit</span>.<a id="i40729076-1"/> Any standalone object with a <span class="code">main</span> method of the proper signature can be used as the entry point into
an application. An example is shown in <a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-summer-app">Listing 4.3</a>:<a id="i558250415-1"/></p>

<h5>Listing 4.3 - The <span class="code">Summer</span> application.</h5>


<p>The name of the singleton object in <a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-summer-app">Listing 4.3</a> is <span class="code">Summer</span>. Its <span class="code">main</span> method has
the proper signature, so you can use it as an application. The first
statement in the file is an import of the <span class="code">calculate</span> method defined
in the <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> object in the previous example. This
import statement allows you to use the method's simple name in the
rest of the file.<a href="classes-and-objects.html#footnotemain4-5">[5]</a> The body of the <span class="code">main</span> method simply prints out each argument and
the checksum for the argument, separated by a colon.</p>

<div class="note">
<h4>Note</h4>


<p>Scala implicitly imports members of packages <span class="code">java.lang</span> and <span class="code">scala</span>, as
well as the members of a singleton object named <span class="code">Predef</span>, into every Scala source
file. <span class="code">Predef</span>, which resides in package <span class="code">scala</span>, contains many useful
methods. For example, when you say <span class="code">println</span> in a Scala source file, 
you're actually invoking <span class="code">println</span> on <span class="code">Predef</span>. (<span class="code">Predef.println</span> turns around and
invokes <span class="code">Console.println</span>, which does the real work.) When you say
<span class="code">assert</span>, you're invoking <span class="code">Predef.assert</span>.<a id="i-783142358-1"/><a id="i586706545-1"/></p>

</div>


<p>To run the <span class="code">Summer</span> application, place the code from <a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-summer-app">Listing 4.3</a>
into a file
named <span class="code">Summer.scala</span>. Because <span class="code">Summer</span> uses <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>,
place the code for <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span>, both the class shown in
<a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-checksum-class">Listing 4.1</a> and its companion object shown in
<a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-checksum-obj">Listing 4.2</a>, into a file named
<span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator.scala</span>.</p>

<p>One difference between Scala and Java is that whereas Java requires
you to put a public class in a file named after the class&mdash;for
example, you'd put class <span class="code">SpeedRacer</span> in file <span class="code">SpeedRacer.java</span>&mdash;in
Scala, you can name <span class="code">.scala</span> files anything you want, no matter what
Scala classes or code you put in them.<a id="i-1061147639-1"/><a id="i982997419-1"/> In general in the case of
non-scripts, however, it is recommended style to name files after the
classes they contain as is done in Java, so that programmers can more
easily locate classes by looking at file names. This is the approach
we've taken with the two files in this example,
<span class="code">Summer.scala</span> and <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator.scala</span>.</p>

<p>Neither <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator.scala</span> nor <span class="code">Summer.scala</span> are scripts, because they end in a definition. A script, by contrast, must end in a
result expression.<a id="i1047419434-2"/> Thus if you try to run <span class="code">Summer.scala</span> as a
script, 
the Scala interpreter will complain that <span class="code">Summer.scala</span> does not end
in a result expression (assuming of course you didn't add
any expression of your own after the <span class="code">Summer</span> object
definition).
Instead, you'll need to actually compile these files with
the Scala compiler, then run the resulting class files. One way to do
this is to use <span class="code">scalac</span>, which is the basic Scala compiler, like
this:<a id="i-674656853-1"/><a id="i-2092005582-1"/><a id="i-1405503952-1"/></p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;scalac&nbsp;ChecksumAccumulator.scala&nbsp;Summer.scala
</pre>


<p>This compiles your source files, but there may be a perceptible delay
before the compilation finishes.  The reason is that
every time the compiler starts up, it spends time scanning
the contents of <span class="code">jar</span> files and doing other initial work before
it even looks at the fresh source files you submit to it.
For this reason,
the Scala distribution also includes a Scala compiler <em>daemon</em>
called <span class="code">fsc</span> (for fast Scala compiler).<a id="i1477728746-1"/> You use it like this:</p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;fsc&nbsp;ChecksumAccumulator.scala&nbsp;Summer.scala
</pre>


<p>The first time you run <span class="code">fsc</span>, it will create a local server daemon
attached to a port on your computer. It will then send the list of
files to compile to the daemon via the port, and the daemon will
compile the files. The next time you run <span class="code">fsc</span>, the daemon will
already be running, so <span class="code">fsc</span> will simply send the file list to the
daemon, which will immediately compile the files. Using <span class="code">fsc</span>, you
only need to wait for the Java runtime to startup the first time. If
you ever want to stop the <span class="code">fsc</span> daemon, you can do so with <span class="code">fsc</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">-shutdown</span>.</p>

<p>Running either of these <span class="code">scalac</span> or <span class="code">fsc</span> commands will produce Java
class files that you can then run via the <span class="code">scala</span> command, the same
command you used to invoke the interpreter in previous
examples.<a id="i1944711780-1"/> However, instead of giving it a filename with a <span class="code">.scala</span>
extension containing Scala code to interpret as you did in every
previous example,<a href="classes-and-objects.html#footnotemain4-6">[6]</a> in this case you'll give it the name of a
standalone object containing a <span class="code">main</span> method of the proper signature.
You can run the <span class="code">Summer</span> application, therefore, by typing:</p>

<pre>
  $&nbsp;scala&nbsp;Summer&nbsp;of&nbsp;love
</pre>


<p>You will see checksums printed for the two command line arguments:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="output">of:&nbsp;-213</code>
  <code class="output">love:&nbsp;-182</code>
</pre>


<h3 id="sec-app-trait">4.5 The <span class="code">App</span> trait</h3>


<p>Scala provides a trait, <span class="code">scala.App</span>, that can save you
some finger typing.<a id="i2043724591-1"/> 
Although we haven't yet covered everything you'll need to understand exactly how
this trait works, we figured you'd want to know about it now anyway.
<a href="classes-and-objects.html#lst-season-app">Listing 4.4</a> shows an example:</p>

<p><a id="lst-season-app"/></p>

<pre>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">import</code>&nbsp;ChecksumAccumulator.calculate
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">object</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">FallWinterSpringSummer</code>&nbsp;<code class="vem">extends</code>&nbsp;<code class="typename">App</code>&nbsp;{
  <br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code class="vem">for</code>&nbsp;(season&nbsp;&lt;-&nbsp;<code class="typename">List</code>(<code class="quotedstring">"fall"</code>,&nbsp;<code class="quotedstring">"winter"</code>,&nbsp;<code class="quotedstring">"spring"</code>))
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println(season&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code class="quotedstring">":&nbsp;"</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;calculate(season))
  &nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre>


<h5>Listing 4.4 - Using the <span class="code">App</span> trait.</h5>


<p>To use the trait, you first write
"<span class="code">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">App</span>" after
the name of your singleton object. Then instead of writing a <span class="code">main</span> method,
you place the code you would have put in the <span class="code">main</span> method
directly between the curly braces of the singleton object. You can 
access command-line arguments via an array of strings named <span class="code">args</span>.
That's it. You can compile and run this
application just like any other.</p>

<h3>4.6 Conclusion</h3>


<p>This chapter has given you the basics of classes and objects in Scala, and
shown you how to compile and run applications. In the next chapter, you'll learn
about Scala's basic types and how to use them.</p>

<h4>Footnotes for Chapter 4:</h4>


<p><a id="footnotemain4-1"/>[1] The reason parameters are <span class="code">val</span>s is
that <span class="code">val</span>s are easier to reason about. You needn't look further to determine
if a <span class="code">val</span> is reassigned, as you must do with a
<span class="code">var</span>.</p>

<p><a id="footnotemain4-2"/>[2] We used a cache here to show a singleton object with
a field. A cache such as this is a performance optimization that
trades off memory for computation time. In general, you would likely
use such a cache only if you encountered a performance problem that
the cache solves, and might use a weak map, such as <span class="code">WeakHashMap</span> in
<span class="code">scala.collection.jcl</span>, so that entries in the cache could be garbage
collected if memory becomes scarce.</p>

<p><a id="footnotemain4-3"/>[3] Because the keyword <span class="code">new</span> is
only used to instantiate classes, the new object created here is an
instance of the <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> class, not the singleton object of
the same name.</p>

<p><a id="footnotemain4-4"/>[4] The name of the synthetic class is the object name plus a dollar sign. Thus the synthetic class
for the singleton object named <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator</span> is <span class="code">ChecksumAccumulator$</span>.</p>

<p><a id="footnotemain4-5"/>[5] If you're a Java programmer, you can
think of this import as similar to the static import feature introduced in Java
5. One difference in Scala, however, is that you can import members from
any object, not just singleton objects.</p>

<p><a id="footnotemain4-6"/>[6] The actual mechanism that the scala program
uses to "interpret" a Scala source file is that it compiles the
Scala source code to Java bytecodes, loads them immediately via a class
loader, and executes them.</p>
