<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p>This book is a tutorial for the Scala programming language, written by
people directly involved in the development of Scala.  Our goal is
that by reading this book, you can learn everything you need to be a
productive Scala programmer. All examples in this book
compile with Scala version 2.11.7, except for those marked
<span class="code">2.12</span>, which compile with 2.12.0-M3.<a id="i88737196-2"/></p>

<h3>Who should read this book</h3>


<p>The main target audience for this book is programmers who want to learn to program
in Scala. If you want to do your next software project in Scala, then
this is the book for you.  In addition, the book should be interesting
to programmers wishing to expand their horizons by learning new concepts.
If you're a Java programmer, for example, reading this book will expose
you to many concepts from functional programming as well as advanced
object-oriented ideas. We believe learning about Scala, and the ideas behind it, can help you become a better
programmer in general.</p>

<p>General programming knowledge is assumed.  
While Scala is a fine first programming language, this is not
the book to use to learn programming.</p>

<p>On the other hand, no specific knowledge of programming languages is
required.  Even though most people use Scala on the Java platform,
this book does not presume you know anything about Java. However,
we expect many readers to be familiar with Java, and so we sometimes
compare Scala to Java to help such readers understand the differences.</p>

<h3>How to use this book</h3>


<p>Because the main purpose of this book is to serve as a tutorial,
the recommended way to read this book is in chapter order, from front to back. We have tried hard to introduce
one topic at a time, and explain new topics only in terms of topics we've
already introduced. Thus, if you skip to the back to get an early peek
at something, you may find it explained in terms of concepts you don't quite
understand. To the extent you read the chapters in order, we think you'll
find it quite straightforward to gain competency in Scala, one step at a time.</p>

<p>If you see a term you do not know, be sure to check the glossary and
the index.  Many readers will skim parts of the book, and that is just
fine.  The glossary and index can help you backtrack whenever you skim
over something too quickly.</p>

<p>After you have read the book once, it should also serve as a language
reference.  There is a formal specification of the Scala language, but<a id="i1552805019-1"/>
the language specification tries for precision at the expense of
readability.  Although this book doesn't cover every detail of Scala,
it is 
quite comprehensive and should serve as an approachable language
reference as you become more adept at programming in Scala.</p>

<h3>How to learn Scala</h3>


<p>You will learn a lot about Scala simply by reading this book from
cover to cover.  You can learn Scala faster and more thoroughly,
though, if you do a few extra things.</p>

<p>First of all, you can take advantage of the many program examples
included in the book.  Typing them in yourself is a way to force your
mind through each line of code.  Trying variations is a way to make
them more fun and to make sure you really understand how they work.</p>

<p>Second, keep in touch with the numerous online forums.  That way, you
and other Scala enthusiasts can help each other.  There are numerous
mailing lists, discussion forums, a chat room, a wiki, and multiple Scala-specific
article feeds.  Take some time to find ones that fit your information
needs. You will spend a lot less time stuck on little problems, so you
can spend your time on deeper, more important questions.</p>

<p>Finally, once you have read enough, take on a programming project of
your own.  Work on a small program from scratch or develop an add-in
to a larger program.  You can only go so far by reading.</p>

<h3>EBook features</h3>


<p>This book is available in both paper and PDF eBook form.
The eBook is not simply an electronic copy of the paper version of
the book.  While the content is the same as in the paper version, the
eBook has been carefully designed and optimized for reading on a computer screen.</p>

<p>The first thing to notice is that most references within the eBook are
hyperlinked.  If you select a reference to a chapter, figure, or
glossary entry, your PDF viewer should take you immediately to the
selected item so that you do not have to flip around to find it.</p>

<p>Additionally, at the bottom of each page in the eBook are a number of navigation
links. The Cover, Overview, and Contents links
take you to the front matter of the book.  The Glossary and
Index links take you to reference parts of the book. Finally, the
Discuss link takes you to an online forum where you
discuss questions with other readers, the authors, and the larger Scala community.
If you find a typo, or something you think could be explained better, please
click on the Suggest link, which will take you to an online web
application where you can give the authors feedback.</p>

<p>Although the same pages appear in the eBook as in the printed book, blank
pages are removed and the remaining pages renumbered. The pages are numbered differently 
so that it is easier for you to determine PDF page numbers when printing only
a portion of the eBook. The pages in the eBook are, therefore, numbered exactly as
your PDF viewer will number them.</p>

<h3>Typographic conventions</h3>


<p>The first time a <em>term</em> is used, it is italicized.
Small code examples, such as <span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>, are written inline with a
mono-spaced font.
Larger code examples are put into mono-spaced quotation blocks like this:</p>

<pre>
  <code class="vem">def</code>&nbsp;hello()&nbsp;=&nbsp;{
  &nbsp;&nbsp;println(<code class="quotedstring">"Hello,&nbsp;world!"</code>)
  }
</pre>


<p>When interactive shells are shown, responses from the shell are shown
in a lighter font:</p>

<pre>
  scala&gt;&nbsp;<code class="literal">3</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code class="literal">4</code>
  <code class="output">res0:&nbsp;Int&nbsp;=&nbsp;7</code>
</pre>
