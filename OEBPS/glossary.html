<p>
<a id="g-725411438"/><span class="glossaryname">algebraic data type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A type defined by providing several alternatives, each of which
    comes with its own constructor. It usually comes with a way
    to decompose the type through pattern matching.
    The concept is found in specification languages and functional programming languages.
    Algebraic data types can be emulated in Scala with case classes.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-196794451"/><span class="glossaryname">alternative</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A branch of a <span class="code">match</span> expression. It has the form "<span class="code">case</span> <em>pattern</em> <span class="code">=&gt;</span> <em>expression</em>." Another
name for alternative is <em>case</em>.<a id="i1197489584-1"/>
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1555043537"/><span class="glossaryname">annotation</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An <em>annotation</em> appears in source code and is attached to some
    part of the syntax.  Annotations are computer processable,
    so you can use them to effectively add an extension to Scala.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-113939451"/><span class="glossaryname">anonymous class</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;An anonymous class is a synthetic subclass generated by the Scala compiler from
a <span class="code">new</span> expression in which the class or trait name is followed by curly braces. The curly braces
contains the body of the anonymous subclass, which may be empty. However, if the name following <span class="code">new</span>
refers to a trait or class that contains abstract members, these must be made concrete inside the
curly braces that define the body of the anonymous subclass.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-657421781"/><span class="glossaryname">anonymous function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another name for function literal.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g93029230"/><span class="glossaryname">apply</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You can <em>apply</em> a method, function, or closure <em>to</em> arguments, which means you invoke it on those arguments.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1589682499"/><span class="glossaryname">argument</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a function is invoked, an <em>argument</em> is passed for each parameter of that function. The parameter is the variable that refers to the argument. The
argument is the object passed at invocation time.
In addition, applications can take (command line) arguments that show up in the <span class="code">Array[String]</span>
passed to <span class="code">main</span> methods of singleton objects.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1408204561"/><span class="glossaryname">assign</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can <em>assign</em> an object <em>to</em> a variable.
Afterwards, the variable will refer to the object.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g729406368"/><span class="glossaryname">auxiliary constructor</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra constructors defined inside the curly braces of the class definition, which
look like method definitions named <span class="code">this</span>, but with no result type.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g93832333"/><span class="glossaryname">block</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
One or more expressions and declarations<a id="i824842378-1"/>
surrounded by curly braces.  When the block evaluates, all of its
expressions and declarations are processed in order, and then the
block returns the value of the last expression as its own value.
Blocks are commonly used as the bodies of functions, <span class="code">for</span> expressions,
<span class="code">while</span> loops, and any other place where you want to group a
number of statements together.
More formally, a block is an encapsulation construct for which you can only see side effects and a
result value.
The curly braces in which you define a class or object do not, therefore, form a block, because fields and
methods (which are defined inside those curly braces) are visible from the outside. Such curly braces form a <em>template</em>.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g183453406"/><span class="glossaryname">bound variable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>bound variable</em> of an expression is a variable that's both used and defined 
    inside the expression. For instance, in the function literal
    expression <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">(x,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y)</span>, both variables <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are used,
    but only <span class="code">x</span> is bound, because it is defined in the expression as an <span class="code">Int</span> and the
    sole argument to the function described by the expression.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1173919606"/><span class="glossaryname">by-name parameter</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A parameter that is marked with a <span class="code">=&gt;</span> in front of the parameter type, <i>e.g.</i>,
    <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>. The argument corresponding to a by-name parameter is evaluated
    not before the method is invoked, but each time the parameter is referenced <em>by name</em>
    inside the method. If a parameter is not by-name, it is <em>by-value</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-430862780"/><span class="glossaryname">by-value parameter</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A parameter that is <em>not</em> marked with a <span class="code">=&gt;</span> in front of the parameter type, <i>e.g.</i>,
    <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>. The argument corresponding to a by-value parameter is evaluated
    before the method is invoked. By-value parameters contrast with <em>by-name</em> parameters.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g94742904"/><span class="glossaryname">class</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Defined with the <span class="code">class</span> keyword, a <em>class</em> may either be abstract or concrete, and may be
parameterized with types and values when instantiated.
    In "<span class="code">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Array[String](2)</span>", the class being instantiated is <span class="code">Array</span> and the type of the value that results is <span class="code">Array[String]</span>. A class that
    takes type parameters is called a <em>type constructor</em>. A type can be said to have a class as well, as in: the class of type <span class="code">Array[String]</span> is <span class="code">Array</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g866552379"/><span class="glossaryname">closure</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A function object that captures free variables, and is said to be "closed" over the variables visible at the time it is created.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-828430492"/><span class="glossaryname">companion class</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A class that shares the same name with a singleton object defined in
the same source file. The class is the singleton object's companion class. 


</p>
<p>
<a id="g423027411"/><span class="glossaryname">companion object</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A singleton object that shares the same name with a class defined in
the same source file. Companion objects and classes have access to each other's private members. In addition,
any implicit conversions defined in the companion object will be in scope anywhere the class is used.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1356412796"/><span class="glossaryname">contravariant</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>contravariant</em> annotation can be applied to a type
    parameter of a class or trait by putting a minus sign (<span class="code">-</span>)
    before the type parameter.  The class or trait
    then subtypes contravariantly with&mdash;in the opposite direction as&mdash;the
    type annotated parameter.  For example, <span class="code">Function1</span> is contravariant
    in its first type parameter, and so <span class="code">Function1[Any,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Any]</span> is
    a subtype of <span class="code">Function1[String,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Any]</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1865839257"/><span class="glossaryname">covariant</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>covariant</em> annotation can be applied to a type
    parameter of a class or trait by putting a plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>)
    before the type parameter.  The class or trait
    then subtypes covariantly with&mdash;in the same direction as&mdash;the
    type annotated parameter.  For example, <span class="code">List</span> is covariant
    in its type parameter, so <span class="code">List[String]</span>  is a subtype of
    <span class="code">List[Any]</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g575993339"/><span class="glossaryname">currying</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A way to write functions with multiple parameter lists.
    For instance <span class="code">def</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">f(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)(y:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span> is a curried function with two parameter lists.
    A curried function is applied by passing several arguments lists, as in:
    <span class="code">f(3)(4)</span>. However, it is also possible to write a <em>partial application</em> of a
    curried function, such as <span class="code">f(3)</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1542341994"/><span class="glossaryname">declare</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can <em>declare</em> an abstract field, method, or type, which gives an entity a name but not an implementation. The key difference between declarations<a id="i1190494299-1"/>
and definitions is that definitions establish an implementation for the named entity, declarations do not.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1335633477"/><span class="glossaryname">define</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To <em>define</em> something in a Scala program is to give it a name and an implementation. You can define classes, traits, singleton objects,<a id="i-1265372713-1"/>
fields, methods, local functions, local variables, <i>etc.</i> Because definitions always involve some kind of implementation, abstract members are <em>declared</em>
not defined.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1336110479"/><span class="glossaryname">direct subclass</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A class is a <em>direct subclass</em> of its direct superclass.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g384896884"/><span class="glossaryname">direct superclass</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The class from which a class or trait is immediately derived,
the nearest class above it in its inheritance hierarchy. If
    a class <span class="code">Parent</span> is mentioned in a class <span class="code">Child</span>'s optional extends clause,
then <span class="code">Parent</span> is the direct superclass of <span class="code">Child</span>. If a trait
   is mentioned in <span class="code">Child</span>'s extends clause, the trait's direct superclass is the <span class="code">Child</span>'s direct superclass.
If <span class="code">Child</span> has no extends clause, then <span class="code">AnyRef</span> is the direct superclass of <span class="code">Child</span>. If a class's
   direct superclass takes type parameters, for example <span class="code">class</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Child</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Parent[String]</span>, the direct superclass of <span class="code">Child</span> is still <span class="code">Parent</span>, 
   not <span class="code">Parent[String]</span>. On the other hand, <span class="code">Parent[String]</span> would be the direct <em>supertype</em> of <span class="code">Child</span>. See <em>supertype</em> for more discussion of the
   distinction between class and type.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g581399802"/><span class="glossaryname">equality</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When used without qualification, <em>equality</em> 
    is the relation between values expressed by `<span class="code">==</span>'. See also <em>reference equality</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1795452264"/><span class="glossaryname">expression</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Any bit of Scala code that yields a result. You can also say that an expression <em>evaluates to</em> a result
or <em>results in</em> a value.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1274492040"/><span class="glossaryname">filter</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An <span class="code">if</span> followed by a boolean expression in a <span class="code">for</span> expression.
In <span class="code">for(i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">to</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">10;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">if</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><span class="texttt">%</span></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">0)</span>, the filter is "<span class="code">if</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><span class="texttt">%</span></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">0</span>".
The value to the right of the <span class="code">if</span> is the <em>filter expression</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1577991104"/><span class="glossaryname">filter expression</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>filter expression</em> is the boolean expression following an <span class="code">if</span> in a <span class="code">for</span> expression. In <span class="code">for(i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">to</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">10;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">if</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><span class="texttt">%</span></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">0)</span>, the filter expression
is "<span class="code">i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><span class="texttt">%</span></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">0</span>".
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1589563862"/><span class="glossaryname">first-class function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scala supports <em>first-class functions</em>, which means you can express functions in <em>function literal</em>
syntax, <i>i.e.</i>, <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>, and that functions can be represented by objects, 
which are called <em>function values</em>.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g1007002221"/><span class="glossaryname">for comprehension</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Another name for <em><span class="code">for</span> expression</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-761850448"/><span class="glossaryname">free variable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>free variable</em> of an expression is a variable that's used inside the expression
    but not defined inside the expression. For instance, in the function literal
    expression <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">(x,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y)</span>, both variables <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are used,
    but only <span class="code">y</span> is a free variable, because it is not defined inside the expression.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1380938712"/><span class="glossaryname">function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A <em>function</em> can be <em>invoked</em> with a list of
               arguments to produce a result.  A function has a
               parameter list, a body, and a result type.
               Functions that are members of a class, trait, or
               singleton object are called <em>methods</em>.
               Functions defined inside other functions are called
               <em>local functions</em>.
               Functions with the result type of <span class="code">Unit</span> are
               called <em>procedures</em>.
  Anonymous functions in source code are called <em>function literals</em>. At run time, function literals
are instantiated into objects called <em>function values</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1911543911"/><span class="glossaryname">function literal</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A function with no name in Scala source code, specified with function literal syntax. For
example, <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">y</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1731647273"/><span class="glossaryname">function value</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A function object that can be invoked just like
any other function.
A function value's class extends one of the <span class="code">FunctionN</span> traits (<i>e.g.</i>, 
<span class="code">Function0</span>, <span class="code">Function1</span>) from package <span class="code">scala</span>, and is usually expressed in source code via <em>function literal</em> syntax. A function value
is "invoked" when its <span class="code">apply</span> method is called. A function value that captures free variables is a <em>closure</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1434668372"/><span class="glossaryname">functional style</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The <em>functional style</em> of programming emphasizes functions
    and evaluation results and deemphasizes the order in which
    operations occur.
    The style is characterized by passing function values into looping
    methods, immutable data, methods with no side effects.  It is the
    dominant paradigm of languages such as Haskell and Erlang, and
    contrasts with the <em>imperative style</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g286956243"/><span class="glossaryname">generator</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>generator</em> defines a named <span class="code">val</span> and assigns to it a series of values in a <span class="code">for</span> expression. For example, in <span class="code">for(i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">to</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">10)</span>, the generator is "<span class="code">i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">to</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">10</span>".
The value to the right of the <span class="code">&lt;-</span> is the <em>generator expression</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-2128716283"/><span class="glossaryname">generator expression</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>generator expression</em> generates a series of values in a <span class="code">for</span> expression. For example, in <span class="code">for(i</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">&lt;-</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">to</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">10)</span>, the generator expression is "<span class="code">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">to</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">10</span>".
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1372927505"/><span class="glossaryname">generic class</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A class that takes type parameters. For example, because <span class="code">scala.List</span> takes a type parameter, <span class="code">scala.List</span> is a generic class.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1357049211"/><span class="glossaryname">generic trait</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A trait that takes type parameters. For example, because trait <span class="code">scala.collection.Set</span> takes a type parameter,
    it is a generic trait.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-59832310"/><span class="glossaryname">helper function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   A function whose purpose is to provide a service to one or more
other functions nearby. Helper functions are often implemented as local functions.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1128216173"/><span class="glossaryname">helper method</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
   A helper function that's a member of a class. Helper methods are often private.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1596987778"/><span class="glossaryname">immutable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An object is <em>immutable</em> if its value cannot be changed after it is created in any way visible to clients. Objects may or may not be immutable.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g148663933"/><span class="glossaryname">imperative style</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The <em>imperative style</em> of programming emphasizes careful
    sequencing of operations so that their effects happen in the right
    order.
    The style is characterized by iteration with loops, mutating data
    in place, and methods with side effects.  It is the dominant
    paradigm of languages such as C, C++, C# and Java, and contrasts
    with the <em>functional style</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g871091088"/><span class="glossaryname">initialize</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When a variable is defined in Scala source code, you must <em>initialize</em> it with an object.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g555127957"/><span class="glossaryname">instance</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An <em>instance</em>, or class instance, is an object, a concept that exists only at run time.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-2086173974"/><span class="glossaryname">instantiate</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To <em>instantiate</em> a class is to make a new object from the class, an action that happens only at run time.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-2131763264"/><span class="glossaryname">invariant</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <em>Invariant</em> is used in two ways.  It can mean a property that always
    holds true when a data structure is well-formed.  For example, it is
    an invariant of a sorted binary tree that each node is ordered before
    its right subnode, if it has a right subnode.  <em>Invariant</em> is also
    sometimes used as a synonym for nonvariant: "class <span class="code">Array</span> is
    invariant in its type parameter."
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1183693704"/><span class="glossaryname">invoke</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You can <em>invoke</em> a method, function, or closure <em>on</em> arguments,
    meaning its body will be executed with the specified arguments.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g73857"/><span class="glossaryname">JVM</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The <em>JVM</em> is the Java Virtual Machine, or <em>runtime</em>, that hosts a running Scala program.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g182460591"/><span class="glossaryname">literal</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>, <span class="code">"One"</span>, and <span class="code">(x:</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int)</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span> are examples
of <em>literals</em>.  A literal is a shorthand way to describe an object,
where the shorthand exactly mirrors the structure of the created
object.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g43293933"/><span class="glossaryname">local function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>local function</em> is a <span class="code">def</span> defined inside a block.  To contrast,
    a <span class="code">def</span> defined as a member of a class, trait, or singleton object is called
    a <em>method</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1707735953"/><span class="glossaryname">local variable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>local variable</em> is a <span class="code">val</span> or <span class="code">var</span> defined inside a block. Although similar to local variables, parameters to functions
are not referred to as local variables, but simply as parameters or "variables" without the "local."


</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1077769574"/><span class="glossaryname">member</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>member</em> is any named element of the template of
    a class, trait, or singleton object.
    A member may be accessed with the name of its owner, a dot, and its simple name.
For example, top-level fields and methods defined in a class are members of that class. A trait defined inside a class is a member
of its enclosing class. A type defined with the <span class="code">type</span> keyword in a class is a member of that class. A class is a member of the package
in which is it defined. By contrast, a local variable or local function is not a member of its surrounding block.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g954925063"/><span class="glossaryname">message</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Actors communicate with each other by sending each other
    <em>messages</em>.  Sending a message does not interrupt what
    the receiver is doing.  The receiver can wait until it has finished
    its current activity and its invariants have been reestablished.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-850220783"/><span class="glossaryname">meta-programming</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meta-programming software is software whose input is itself
    software.  Compilers are meta-programs, as are tools like
    <span class="code">scaladoc</span>.  Meta-programming software is required in order
    to do anything with an <em>annotation</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1077554975"/><span class="glossaryname">method</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>method</em> is a function that is a member of some class, trait, or singleton object.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g103910529"/><span class="glossaryname">mixin</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>Mixin</em> is what a trait is called when it is being used in a mixin composition. In other words, in "<span class="code">trait</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Hat</span>," <span class="code">Hat</span> is just a trait, but in
"<span class="code">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Cat</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">extends</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">AnyRef</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">with</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Hat</span>," <span class="code">Hat</span> can be called a mixin. When used as a verb, "mix in" is two words. For example, you
can <em>mix</em> traits <em>in</em>to classes or other traits.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-528906101"/><span class="glossaryname">mixin composition</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The process of mixing traits into classes or other traits. <em>Mixin composition</em> differs from traditional multiple inheritance in that
the type of the <span class="code">super</span> reference is not known at the point the trait is defined, but rather is determined anew each time
the trait is mixed into a class or other trait.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-615513385"/><span class="glossaryname">modifier</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A keyword that qualifies a class, trait, field, or method definition in some way. For
    example, the <span class="code">private</span> modifier indicates that a class, trait, field, or method being defined is private.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-181260432"/><span class="glossaryname">multiple definitions</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The same expression can be assigned in <em>multiple definitions</em>
    if you use the syntax
    <span class="code">val</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><i>v1</i>,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><i>v2</i>,</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><i>v3</i></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><i>exp</i></span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-233237224"/><span class="glossaryname">nonvariant</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A type parameter of a class or trait is by default <em>nonvariant</em>.
    The class or trait then does not subtype when that parameter
    changes.  For example, because class <span class="code">Array</span> is nonvariant in its type parameter,
    <span class="code">Array[String]</span> is neither a subtype nor a supertype of
    <span class="code">Array[Any]</span>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1662702951"/><span class="glossaryname">operation</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In Scala, every <em>operation</em> is a method call. Methods may be invoked in <em>operator notation</em>, such as <span class="code">b</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>, and when in that notation, <span class="code">+</span> is
an <em>operator</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1954460585"/><span class="glossaryname">parameter</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Functions may take zero to many <em>parameters</em>. Each parameter has a name and a type. The<a id="i-1413740950-1"/><a id="i-1309185960-1"/>
distinction between parameters and arguments is that
arguments refer to the actual objects passed when a function is invoked. Parameters are the variables that refer to those passed arguments.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1701137034"/><span class="glossaryname">parameterless function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A function that takes no parameters, which is defined without any empty parentheses.
Invocations of parameterless functions may not supply parentheses. This supports the <em>uniform access principle</em>, which enables
the <span class="code">def</span> to be changed into a <span class="code">val</span> without requiring a change to client code.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1903107585"/><span class="glossaryname">parameterless method</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>parameterless method</em> is a parameterless function that is a member of a class, trait, or singleton object.

    A field defined as a class parameter.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1880499411"/><span class="glossaryname">partially applied function</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A function that's used in an expression
    and that misses some of its arguments.
    For instance, if function <span class="code">f</span> has type <span class="code">Int</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Int</span>, then
    <span class="code">f</span> and <span class="code">f(1)</span> are <em>partially applied functions</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1121900131"/><span class="glossaryname">path-dependent type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A type like <span class="code">swiss.cow.Food</span>.  The
    <span class="code">swiss.cow</span> part is a <em>path</em> that forms a reference to an object. The meaning of the type
    is sensitive to the path you use to access it.  The types
    <span class="code">swiss.cow.Food</span> and <span class="code">fish.Food</span>, for example, are different types.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-791090288"/><span class="glossaryname">pattern</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In a <span class="code">match</span> expression alternative, a <em>pattern</em> follows each <span class="code">case</span> keyword and precedes either a <em>pattern guard</em> or the <span class="code">=&gt;</span> symbol.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g624636437"/><span class="glossaryname">pattern guard</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In a <span class="code">match</span> expression alternative, a <em>pattern guard</em> can follow a <em>pattern</em>.
    For example, in "<span class="code">case</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">if</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><span class="texttt">%</span></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">0</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">+</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">1</span>", the pattern guard is "<span class="code">if</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>&nbsp;<span class="code"><span class="texttt">%</span></span>&nbsp;<span class="code">2</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">==</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">0</span>". A case with a pattern guard will only
    be selected if the pattern matches and the pattern guard yields true.

<p>
<a id="g-1348032073"/><span class="glossaryname">predicate</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>predicate</em> is a function with a <span class="code">Boolean</span> result type.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1733976356"/><span class="glossaryname">primary constructor</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The main constructor of a class, which invokes a superclass constructor, if necessary,
initializes fields to passed values,
and executes any top-level code defined between the curly braces of the class.
Fields are initialized only for value parameters not passed to the superclass constructor, except for any that
are not used in the body of the class and can therefore be optimized away.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1095204141"/><span class="glossaryname">procedure</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>procedure</em> is a function with result type of <span class="code">Unit</span>, which is therefore executed solely for its side effects.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1752969532"/><span class="glossaryname">reassignable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A variable may or may not be <em>reassignable</em>.  A <span class="code">var</span>
    is reassignable while a <span class="code">val</span> is not.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g1165780018"/><span class="glossaryname">recursive</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A function is <em>recursive</em> if it calls itself. If the only place the function calls itself is the last expression
of the function, then the function is <em>tail recursive</em>.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-925155509"/><span class="glossaryname">reference</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <em>reference</em> is the Java abstraction of a pointer, which uniquely identifies an object that resides on the JVM's heap.
Reference type variables hold references to objects, because reference types (instances of <span class="code">AnyRef</span>) are implemented as Java objects that
reside on the JVM's heap.<a id="i-396510763-1"/>
Value type variables, by contrast, may sometimes hold a reference (to a boxed wrapper type) and sometimes not (when
the object is being represented as a primitive value).
Speaking generally, a Scala variable <em>refers</em> to an object. The term "refers" is more
abstract than "holds a reference."
If a variable of type <span class="code">scala.Int</span> is currently represented as a primitive Java <span class="code">int</span> value, then that variable
still refers to the <span class="code">Int</span> object, but no reference is involved.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g1293228591"/><span class="glossaryname">reference equality</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <em>Reference equality</em> means that two references identify the very same Java object.
Reference equality can be determined, for reference types only, by calling <span class="code">eq</span> in <span class="code">AnyRef</span>. (In Java programs, reference equality can be determined 
using <span class="code">==</span> on Java reference types.)
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-1958144273"/><span class="glossaryname">reference type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A <em>reference type</em> is a subclass of <span class="code">AnyRef</span>. Instances of reference types always reside on the JVM's heap at run time.

<p>
<a id="g-1825668081"/><span class="glossaryname">referential transparency</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  A property of functions that are independent
of temporal context and have no side effects. For a particular input, an invocation
of a referentially transparent function can be replaced by its result without
changing the program semantics.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g-934829069"/><span class="glossaryname">refers</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A variable in a running Scala program always <em>refers</em> to some object. Even if that variable is assigned to <span class="code">null</span>, it conceptually refers to
the <span class="code">Null</span> object. At runtime, an object may be implemented by a Java object or a value of a primitive type, but Scala allows programmers to think at a 
higher level of abstraction about their code as they imagine it running. See also <em>reference</em>.

<p>
<a id="g1264110831"/><span class="glossaryname">refinement type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  A type formed by supplying a base type a number of members inside
  curly braces.  The members in the curly braces refine the types that
  are present in the base type.  For example, the type of "animal
  that eats grass" is
  <span class="code">Animal</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">{</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">SuitableFood</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">=</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">Grass</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">}</span>.

<a id="g-595246755"/><span class="glossaryname">result type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A method's <em>result type</em> is the type of the value that results from calling the method. (In Java, this concept is
called the return type.)

<p>
<a id="g-934396624"/><span class="glossaryname">return</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A function in a Scala program <em>returns</em> a value. You can call this value the <em>result</em> of the function. You can

    The Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, that hosts a running Scala program. <em>Runtime</em> encompasses
both the virtual machine, as defined by the Java Virtual Machine Specification, and the runtime libraries of the
Java API and the standard Scala API. The phrase <em>at run time</em> (with a space between <em>run</em> and <em>time</em>) means when the program is running, and contrasts
with compile time.

    A <em>self type</em> of a trait is the assumed type of <span class="code">this</span>, the

An object defined with the <span class="code">object</span> keyword. Each singleton object has one and only one instance. A singleton
object that shares its name with a class, and is defined in the same source file as that class, is that class's

<a id="g-1867567750"/><span class="glossaryname">subtype</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Scala compiler will allow any of a type's <em>subtypes</em> to be used as a substitute wherever that
type is required. For classes and traits that take no type<a id="i-155377413-1"/>
parameters, the subtype relationship mirrors the subclass relationship. For example, if class <span class="code">Cat</span> is a subclass of abstract class <span class="code">Animal</span>, and 
neither takes type parameters, type <span class="code">Cat</span> is a subtype of type <span class="code">Animal</span>. Likewise, if trait <span class="code">Apple</span> is a subtrait of trait <span class="code">Fruit</span>, and neither
takes type parameters, type <span class="code">Apple</span> is a subtype of type <span class="code">Fruit</span>. For classes and traits that take type parameters, however, variance comes into
play. For example, because abstract class <span class="code">List</span> is declared to be covariant in its lone type parameter (<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="code">List</span> is declared <span class="code">List[+A]</span>),
<span class="code">List[Cat]</span> is a subtype of <span class="code">List[Animal]</span>, and <span class="code">List[Apple]</span> a subtype of <span class="code">List[Fruit]</span>. These subtype relationships exist even
though the class of each of these types is <span class="code">List</span>. By contrast, because <span class="code">Set</span> is not declared to be covariant in its type parameter (<i>i.e.</i>, <span class="code">Set</span> is declared 
<span class="code">Set[A]</span> with no plus sign), <span class="code">Set[Cat]</span> is <em>not</em> a subtype of <span class="code">Set[Animal]</span>.
A subtype should correctly implement the contracts of its supertypes,
so that the Liskov Substitution Principle applies, but the compiler only
verifies this property at the level of type checking.

<a id="g110621198"/><span class="glossaryname">trait</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <em>trait</em>, which is defined with the <span class="code">trait</span> keyword, is like an abstract class that cannot take any value parameters and
can be "mixed into" classes or other traits via the process known as <em>mixin composition</em>.
When a trait is being mixed into a class or trait, it is called a <em>mixin</em>. A trait may be parameterized with one or more types. When parameterized
with types, the trait constructs a type. For example, <span class="code">Set</span> is a trait that takes a single type parameter, whereas <span class="code">Set[Int]</span> is a type. 
Also, <span class="code">Set</span> is said to be "the trait of" type <span class="code">Set[Int]</span>.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g3575610"/><span class="glossaryname">type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Every variable and expression in a Scala program has a <em>type</em> that is known at compile time.
A type restricts the possible values to which a variable can refer, or an expression can produce, at run time.
A variable or expression's type can also<a id="i-1395189617-1"/><a id="i-1148073513-1"/>
be referred to as a <em>static type</em> if necessary to differentiate it from an object's <em>runtime type</em>. In
other words, "type" by itself means static type.
Type is distinct from class because a class that takes type parameters can construct many types. For example,
<span class="code">List</span> is a class, but not a type. <span class="code">List[T]</span> is a type with a free type parameter. <span class="code">List[Int]</span> and
<span class="code">List[String]</span> are also types (called <em>ground types</em> because they have no free type parameters).<a id="i-1740168280-1"/> A type
can have a "class" or "trait." For example, the class of type <span class="code">List[Int]</span> is <span class="code">List</span>. The trait of
type <span class="code">Set[String]</span> is <span class="code">Set</span>.


</p>
<p>
<a id="g1827075715"/><span class="glossaryname">type constraint</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Some annotations are <em>type constraints</em>, meaning that they add
    additional limits, or constraints, on what values the type
    includes.  For example, <span class="code">@positive</span> could be a
    type constraint on the type <span class="code">Int</span>, limiting the type of 32-bit
    integers down to those that are positive.  Type constraints are
    not checked by the standard Scala compiler, but must instead be
    checked by an extra tool or by a compiler plugin.

<a id="g772613699"/><span class="glossaryname">type parameter</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    A parameter to a generic class or

    class <span class="code">List</span> is defined as "<span class="code">class</span> <span class="code">List[T]</span> { ...",

<a id="g729932460"/><span class="glossaryname">uniform access principle</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The <em>uniform access principle</em> states that variables and parameterless functions should be accessed using the same syntax.
Scala supports this principle by not allowing parentheses to be placed at call sites of parameterless functions. As a result, a
parameterless function definition can be changed to a <span class="code">val</span>, or <i>vice versa</i>, without affecting client code.

of <span class="code">AnyRef</span>) are implemented as objects that reside on the JVM's heap. When an instance of a reference type
becomes unreachable, it indeed becomes unreferenced, and is available for garbage collection. Value types (instances
of <span class="code">AnyVal</span>) are implemented as both primitive type values and as instances of Java wrapper types (such as <span class="code">java.lang.Integer</span>),
which reside on the heap. Value type instances can be boxed (converted from a primitive value to a wrapper object) and unboxed
(converted from a wrapper object to a primitive value) throughout the lifetime of the variables that refer to them.
If a value type instance currently represented as a wrapper object on the JVM's heap becomes unreachable, it indeed becomes
unreferenced, and is available for garbage collection. But if a value type currently represented as a primitive value becomes
unreachable, then it does not become unreferenced, because it does not exist as an object on the JVM's heap at that point in time.
The runtime may reclaim memory occupied by unreachable objects, but if an <span class="code">Int</span>, for example, is implemented at run time by
a primitive Java <span class="code">int</span> that occupies some memory in the stack frame of an executing method, then the memory for that
object is "reclaimed" when the stack frame is popped as the method completes. Memory for reference types, such
as <span class="code">String</span>s, may be reclaimed by the JVM's garbage collector after they become unreachable.

<a id="g111972721"/><span class="glossaryname">value</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The result of any computation or expression in Scala is a <em>value</em>, and in Scala, every value is an object.
The term value essentially means the image of an object in memory (on the JVM's heap or stack).

<a id="g1985162377"/><span class="glossaryname">value type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <em>value type</em> is any subclass of <span class="code">AnyVal</span>, such as <span class="code">Int</span>, <span class="code">Double</span>, or <span class="code">Unit</span>. This term has meaning at the level of Scala source
code. At runtime, instances of value types that correspond to Java primitive types may be implemented in terms of primitive type values
or instances of wrapper types, such as <span class="code">java.lang.Integer</span>. Over the lifetime of a value type instance, the runtime may transform
it back and forth between primitive and wrapper types (<i>i.e.</i>, to box and unbox it).

<a id="g-1249586564"/><span class="glossaryname">variable</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A named entity that refers to an object. A variable is either a <span class="code">val</span> or a <span class="code">var</span>. Both <span class="code">val</span>s and
   <span class="code">var</span>s must be initialized when defined, but only <span class="code">var</span>s can be later reassigned to refer to a different object.

<a id="g-1249575311"/><span class="glossaryname">variance</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A type parameter of a class or trait can be marked with
    a <em>variance</em> annotation, either <em>covariant</em> (<span class="code">+</span>)
    or <em>contravariant</em> (<span class="code">-</span>).  Such variance annotations
    indicate how subtyping works for a generic class or
    trait.  For example, the generic class <span class="code">List</span> is covariant
    in its type parameter, and thus <span class="code">List[String]</span> is a subtype
    of <span class="code">List[Any]</span>. By default, <i>i.e.</i>, absent a <span class="code">+</span> or <span class="code">-</span> annotation,
    type parameters are <em>nonvariant</em>.

<a id="g836624832"/><span class="glossaryname">wildcard type</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    A wildcard type includes references to type variables
    that are unknown.  For example, <span class="code">Array[_]</span>
    is a wildcard type. It is an array where the element
    type is completely unknown.
</p>
<p>
<a id="g114974605"/><span class="glossaryname">yield</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    An expression can <em>yield</em> a result. The <span class="code">yield</span> keyword designates the result of a <span class="code">for</span> expression.
