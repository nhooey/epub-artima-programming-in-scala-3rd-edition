<h1>About the Authors</h1>


<p><span class="textbf">Martin Odersky</span> is the creator of the Scala language. He is a
professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, and a founder of 
Typesafe, Inc. He works on programming languages and systems, more
specifically on the topic of how to combine object-oriented and
functional programming. Since 2001 he has concentrated on designing,
implementing, and refining Scala. Previously, he has influenced the
development of Java as a co-designer of Java generics and as the
original author of the current <pre class="code">javac</pre> reference compiler.  He is a
fellow of the ACM.</p>

<p><span class="textbf">Lex Spoon</span> is a software engineer at Semmle, Ltd.  He worked on Scala
for two years as a post-doc at EPFL.  He has a Ph.D.
from Georgia Tech, where he worked on static analysis of
dynamic languages.  In addition to Scala, he has helped develop a wide
variety of programming languages, including the dynamic language
Smalltalk, the scientific language X10, and the logic language that
powers Semmle.  He and his wife live in
Atlanta with two cats and a chihuahua.</p>

<p><span class="textbf">Bill Venners</span> is president of Artima, Inc., publisher of the Artima
Developer website (www.artima.com), and cofounder of Escalate Software, LLC. He is author of the book, <em>Inside
the Java Virtual Machine</em>, a programmer-oriented survey of the Java
platform's architecture and internals. His popular columns in
JavaWorld magazine covered Java internals, object-oriented design, and
Jini. Active in the Jini Community since its
inception, Bill led the Jini Community's ServiceUI project, whose
ServiceUI API became the de facto standard way to associate user
interfaces to Jini services. Bill is also the lead developer
and designer of ScalaTest, an open source testing tool for Scala
and Java developers.</p>
