<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>


<p>Many people have contributed to this book and to the material it covers.
We are grateful to all of them.</p>

<p>Scala itself has been a collective effort of many people. The design
and the implementation of version 1.0 was helped by Philippe Altherr,
Vincent Cremet, Gilles Dubochet, Burak Emir, St&eacute;phane Micheloud,
Nikolay Mihaylov, Michel Schinz, Erik Stenman, and Matthias Zenger.
Phil Bagwell, Antonio Cunei, Iulian Dragos, Gilles Dubochet, Miguel
Garcia, Philipp Haller, Sean McDirmid, Ingo Maier, Donna Malayeri,
Adriaan Moors, Hubert Plociniczak, Paul Phillips, Aleksandar Prokopec,
Tiark Rompf, Lukas Rytz, and Geoffrey Washburn joined in the effort to
develop the second and current version of the language and tools.</p>

<p>Gilad Bracha, Nathan Bronson, Caoyuan, Aemon Cannon, Craig Chambers,
Chris Conrad, Erik Ernst, Matthias Felleisen, Mark Harrah, Shriram
Krishnamurti, Gary Leavens, David MacIver, Sebastian Maneth, Rickard
Nilsson, Erik Meijer, Lalit Pant, David Pollak, Jon Pretty, Klaus
Ostermann, Jorge Ortiz, Didier R&eacute;my, Miles Sabin, Vijay Saraswat,
Daniel Spiewak, James Strachan, Don Syme, Erik Torreborre, Mads
Torgersen, Philip Wadler, Jamie Webb, John Williams, Kevin Wright, and
Jason Zaugg have shaped the design of the language by graciously
sharing their ideas with us in lively and inspiring discussions, by
contributing important pieces of code to the open source effort, as
well as through comments on previous versions of this document. The
contributors to the Scala mailing list have also given very useful
feedback that helped us improve the language and its tools.</p>

<p>George Berger has worked tremendously to make the build process and
the web presence for the book work smoothly.  As a result this project
has been delightfully free of technical snafus.</p>

<p>Many people gave us valuable feedback on early versions of the
text.  Thanks goes
to Eric Armstrong, George Berger, Alex Blewitt, Gilad Bracha, William
Cook, Bruce Eckel, St&eacute;phane Micheloud, Todd Millstein, David Pollak,
Frank Sommers, Philip Wadler, and Matthias Zenger. Thanks also to the

<p>A special thanks to Dave Briccetti and Adriaan Moors for reviewing the third
